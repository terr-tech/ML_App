# ML_Apps

This repo contains the little scripts I build to test out my knowledge in regression, NLP, etc.

The chat_bot_core_problem.py file contains a python script:

  1. It reads in datasets about a story, a query and a yes/no answer.
  2. It tokenizes the text data (vectorization)
  3. It then drafts a simple neural network with the python library keras
  4. Evaluation with user inputs
 

This repository acts as an online storage for self-taught projects
